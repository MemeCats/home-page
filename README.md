# home-page
A simple bookmark management tool. It allows users to add custom website links, including the website name, URL, and icon. Users can add new websites by clicking the plus icon and entering the relevant information. When a website is added, it is displayed as a card on the page, including the website name, icon, and a delete button. Clicking the delete button removes the corresponding website. Additionally, the website offers import and export functionality, allowing users to export their custom website links as a JSON file and import them when needed.
